# Hey, I'm Oli!

I'm a Swedish student who loves tinkering with code and learning new things.  
I experiment with all sorts of bits and bobs! Which typically involves a healthy amount of programming.  
My recent obsession has been with **calendars** for which I've made [a few projects](https://github.com/stars/olillin/lists/calendars) from websites to libraries and utilities.  

## Here's some of the things I've done

💻 Front-end website development using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and CSS.  
⚡ Back-end and API:s with TypeScript and [Express](https://expressjs.com).  
🔌 Minecraft mod and plugin development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) (prev. Java.)  
🐧 Linux server management. Currently [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) but planning to move to a shared [NixOS](https://nixos.org) configuration with my other machines.  
🐍 Utility and QoL [Python](https://www.python.org) and [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com) scripts for automation of simple tasks.  
🖨 3D-printing on my [Ender 3 Neo](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ender-3-neo).  
🎨 Graphic design in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator).  
🔮 Minecraft [data packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack), commands and resource packs.  

## Software?

❄️ For the past few months I've been running [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and really enjoyed the experience!  
🖊️ My usual editor is [Neovim](https://neovim.io), although my config leaves much to be desired. I occassionally use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) when programming in Kotlin or Java.  
📂 The file explorer I use is [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io) with *most* plugins installed.  
🎨 I use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for anything image-related.
