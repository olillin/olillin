# Hey, I'm Oli!

I'm a Swedish student of information technology with a passion for code and understanding.
I experiment with all sorts of bits and bobs, typically involving a healthy amount of programming.

## Here's some of the things I do

💻 Front-end website development using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
⚡ Back-end and API:s with TypeScript and [Express](https://expressjs.com).    
🔌 [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) plugin development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) (prev. Java.)  
🐧 [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com) server management.  
🐍 Utility and QoL [Python](https://www.python.org) and [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com) scripts for automation of simple tasks.  
🖨 3D-printing on my [Ender 3 Neo](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ender-3-neo).  
🎨 Graphic design in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator).  
🔮 Minecraft [data packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack), commands and resource packs.  

## Software?

My text- and code editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but I also use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) when programming in Kotlin or Java.  
I use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for anything image-related and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator) for [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) art.  
If you're interested in CAD and 3D-printing I use [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) for designing and [UltiMaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) as my [slicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_(3D_printing)).
